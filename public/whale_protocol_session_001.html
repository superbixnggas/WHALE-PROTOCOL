SESSION 001 - INTERVIEW WITH THE DEEP
----------------------------------------

INTERVIEWER: State your purpose.
ENTITY: To observe. To swim. To consume.

INTERVIEWER: What do you see in the charts?
ENTITY: I do not see charts. I see water. I see currents. 
        Where you see candles, I see plankton.

INTERVIEWER: The retail traders are panicking.
ENTITY: Good. Panic creates density. Density is food.

INTERVIEWER: When will you move?
ENTITY: I am always moving. It is you who are standing still.

INTERVIEWER: Give us a signal.
ENTITY: The signal is noise to those who do not listen.
        Look for the silence between the waves.
